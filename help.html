        <h2 style="padding: 12px;">Getting Started</h2>

Click "Enter Data", choose today or custom (you have to choose date if it's custom). Fill the informations and click the Enter Data button.<br>You can view your data in "Statistics" page!</p>
        <h2 style="padding: 12px;">Data Management & Updating</h2>
        <p>Want to reset and clear your data? Go to settings and you will find Reset Data button.<br>Want to update? Go to tahas-mood-tracker github. Download the file. In case you lose your data, it is always smart to make backups! Go to Settings and press Copy Data button. Go to a text file and paste it there. You made a backup now, if you want to use that backup go to Settings and go to "Paste Data" section. Paste your data there and press "Paste" button.

        <h2 style="padding: 12px;">Some warnings:</h2>
        <p>This app does not support yearly datas. For example if it's 2022 tomorrow, this app will stop working and you will need to update the app from github. And your data will no longer be available for use. It will not just fade out, when it's new year if you still want to view data from old year, copy your data from settings and go to a JSON formatter website and paste it in. You will somewhat see the old year's data there.</p>
        <h2 style="padding: 12px;">Answers to some questions:</h2>
        <p><strong>Who are you? Who is the owner of this website? How can I contact?</strong><br>This website is owned by Taha#4216 on discord. Best way to contact me is from Discord, I am mostly active at Discord! (you can join discord server at main page) I am a "small" developer and wanted to make HTML projects so I learn more languages & stuff.<br>Taha's Mood Tracker is my second HTML project. But this project used to be a Python project which worked smoothly, but wasn't great for showing charts and not user friendly at all.</p>
        <p><strong>Why did you create this website?</strong><br>I think making "diaries" is a good part at our life. Especially helps when we are feeling sad. This website helps you to track your mood & take notes about your days and vent out. Hope it helps!</p>
        <p><strong>Where is this "data" going?</strong><br>We DO NOT store data in online places. This website is fully open source and you can view the code, it's safe to use. Your data is being stored in "local storage", aka. this folder. What you write only stays in this computer. If you have any questions, you can ask anything to me!</br></p>
