# Taha's Mood Tracker App

Hello! This is a very simple project i'm working on: mood tracker app.

This is a very basic app and not user-friendly for now.

If you want to use this app, you have to do several things:

1 - Download it

2 - You need to download python 3.9 (or any version close to this I guess)

3 - You need to do "pip install"

4 - When you enter, you need to enter the password which is "TahaMadeThisApp" or "lazypass"

5 - enjoy


Because of setup being too complicated, this app is not recommended for use if you don't know basic python. This will be turned into .exe file and have a GUI in future!
