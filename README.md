Taha's Mood Tracker App (v2.0.0-pre1)
----
Hello! This is a BASIC html application I made to track moods and make diaries.

This app was made in python console first, then turned it to python w/Tkinter, and now I made it HTML & JavaScript.

You can enter your stress and mood rating, activities and diary about that day.

You will be able to track your mood with stats (but this is currently not done in this pre-release, for now you can only view your diary and today-only stats.

Please open main.html first, don't open other ones.

For more additional information about it navigate to help page in the app.

It's an open source app, enjoy it! Feel free to contact me any time.
