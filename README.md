## Taha's Mood Tracker App (Basic Description)
----
Open main.html first to start the app.

Hello! This is a BASIC html application I made to track moods and make diaries.

This app was made in python console first, then turned it to python w/Tkinter, and now I made it HTML & JavaScript.

You can enter your stress and mood rating, activities and diary about that day.

You will be able to track your mood and stress index with graphs.

For more additional information about it navigate to help page in the app.

It's an open source app, enjoy it! Feel free to contact me any time.
