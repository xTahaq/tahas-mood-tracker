# Taha's Mood Tracker App

Hello! This is a very simple project i'm working on: mood tracker app.

This is a very basic app and not user-friendly for now.

If you want to use this app, you have to do several things:

1 - Download it

2 - You need to download python 3.9 (or any version close to this I guess)

3 - You need to do "pip install"

4 - When you enter, you need to enter the password which is "TahaMadeThisApp" or "lazypass"

5 - enjoy

Because of setup being too complicated, if you are not a basic python user you will struggle doing these steps probably, if you don't know how to do any of these steps please skip because app will not work. This will be turned into .exe file and have a GUI in future!
